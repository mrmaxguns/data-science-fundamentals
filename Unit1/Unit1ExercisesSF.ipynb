    "Both are numeric types, and therefore allow the use of standard numeric operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, etc. Operations can mix `int`s and `float`s, although the result will be a `float`. The python `math` library provides utilities for simple numeric operations. For a much more comprehensive approach, `numpy` seamlessly integrates both data types with its own types.\n",
    "\n",
    "`int`s in Python represent integers, are exact, and don't have a limit on size. `float`s represent decimal values, but their precision is limited by Python internals. Notably, floating-point error affects python `float`s. Numpy provides specific-precision floating-point types to compensate for this."
